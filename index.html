    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h5>Born and raised in Indiana, I am a traveling enthusiast with the goal of seeing the most beautiful places on Earth. 
        Nevertheless, I am a passionate student of technology. 
        I have a strong background in analytics and pursuing 
        computer science to create meaningful and interesting 
        projects that help me learn the ever growing boundaries of technology.

            <h3>Fitness</h3>
            <p>My whole life I have played a sport, from soccer to swimming to football and 
                now I dedicate most of my life to working out and playing basketball 
                just because my health is one of the most important things to me
            </p>

            <h3>Travels</h3>
            <p>Thankfully I was blessed to be born into a family which allowed me to travel the world. 
                Because of my family I have been to many countries and experienced differnet geographies that could never be possible 
                in Indiana. I have seen so many different cultures and learned so much more from the history of a country to 
                a possible future the country is trying to reach. 
            </p>

            <h3>Future</h3>
            <p>My parents are my biggest motivators in my life. They both came from India 
                and fought for everything they have and everything I have so my biggest goal is to repay them. 
                Learning from them I decided to go into a technology field for my undergrad in college 
                because from what I can see the future revolves around how fast technology evolves.
